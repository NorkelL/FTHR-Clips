## What it does

FTHRClips run silently in the background capturing your game and when you press a hotkey it saves the clip. But unlike other applications FTHRClips is built to protect your privacy and doesn't depend on a network connection.

## Features

| Category | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| **Capture** | GPU-accelerated recording via NVENC / AMF / QSV (CPU OpenH264 fallback) |
| **Capture** | Crash-resilient manual recordings written directly as fragmented MP4 with live AAC; no stop-time re-encode or whole-file remux |
| **Capture** | Configurable replay history up to 5 minutes and up to 240 FPS; Low, Medium, High, or custom bitrate |
| **Capture** | H.264, HEVC and AV1 selection; Windows uses backend-defined presets |
| **Capture** | Monitor selection and scaling modes |
| **Hotkeys** | Global hotkeys via Hyprland binds (Linux) or system hooks (Windows); Windows supports controller chords |
| **Hotkeys** | Save clip · Start/stop · Dismiss notification |
| **Audio** | System-output and microphone tracks; Windows 11 per-app stems are code-ready but still require hardware qualification (aka we fucked up and it didn't work)|
| **Post-processing** | Watermark overlay |
| **Post-processing** | Webcam overlay (picture-in-picture) |
| **Post-processing** | Windows third-party keyboard window overlay with live chroma-key color picking and intensity control |
| **Game detection** | Auto-detects game window, prompts to switch capture focus |
| **Settings** | Presets — save/load/delete full configuration snapshots |
| **Clip browser** | Thumbnail grid, linked-folder protection, trim editor and transactional export |
| **Upload** | Optional, consent-installed Catbox or Lustful uploader; Lustful hardware identity is a second install |
| **Packaging** | Windows installer and experimental Linux AppImage build paths |

## Download

you can download a ready installer or app image right on our downloads page 
downloads.fthrclips.com
or compile the code yourself with this repo.


## Linux Setup

The supported Linux distribution path is the **x86_64 AppImage on a native
Wayland desktop**. The merged Linux branch has been exercised on Arch Linux
with Hyprland, PipeWire/PulseAudio, Wayland capture, and an AMD Radeon RX 7900
XTX. Other distributions, compositors, GPUs, and X11 sessions may work, but
should be treated as unqualified until tested on that hardware.

### Install and launch the AppImage

Download the latest Linux pre-release from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/FTHR-Community/FTHR-Clips/releases/tag/v1.1.0-alpha), or use the direct links below:

- [FTHRClips-1.1.0-alpha-x86_64.AppImage](https://github.com/FTHR-Community/FTHR-Clips/releases/download/v1.1.0-alpha/FTHRClips-1.1.0-alpha-x86_64.AppImage)
- [SHA-256 checksum](https://github.com/FTHR-Community/FTHR-Clips/releases/download/v1.1.0-alpha/FTHRClips-1.1.0-alpha-x86_64.AppImage.sha256)

Then run:

```bash
chmod +x FTHRClips-1.1.0-alpha-x86_64.AppImage
./FTHRClips-1.1.0-alpha-x86_64.AppImage
```

If FUSE is unavailable, use the portable fallback:

```bash
APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1 ./FTHRClips-<version>-x86_64.AppImage
```

The current AppImage includes the optional Linux uploader bundle. Uploading is
still disabled until you enable it and accept the relevant consent and provider
terms in the application. Catbox and custom-server uploads do not require the
separate hardware-identity component. Lustful hardware-bound uploading is not
available on Linux.

### Requirements

- x86_64 Linux with a native graphical session
- Wayland compositor exposing `wlr-screencopy` or
  `ext-image-copy-capture`, or an `org.freedesktop.portal.ScreenCast`
  backend (`xdg-desktop-portal-kde` on KDE Plasma/KWin) together with
  PipeWire and D-Bus
- PipeWire with PulseAudio compatibility, or PulseAudio
- `grim` for screenshots (the ScreenCast portal path covers video only) and
  `nc`/netcat for compositor hotkey commands
- A working FFmpeg runtime supplied by the AppImage
- AMD VA-API users should install the Mesa VA-API driver and ensure the user
  can access `/dev/dri/renderD*`; software encoding remains the fallback

Arch example:

```bash
sudo pacman -S wayland wayland-protocols pipewire pipewire-pulse \
  grim openbsd-netcat libva-mesa-driver mesa-utils
```

Debian/Ubuntu package names vary by release. Install the equivalent Wayland,
PipeWire/PulseAudio, `grim`, netcat, and Mesa VA-API packages.

### Wayland capture and audio

On Wayland, FTHR first tries `wlr-screencopy` and then
`ext-image-copy-capture`, using only protocols the compositor advertises. When
neither is offered (KWin exports capture only through the desktop portal), it
falls back to the `org.freedesktop.portal.ScreenCast` portal and reads the
frames from PipeWire. The desktop shows its own screen picker the first time;
FTHR stores the portal's restore token in `~/.fthr/portal_screencast_token`
so later starts are silent, and the picker rather than the app's monitor
setting decides which screen is captured. Declining the picker stops the
engine with that reason in the app instead of re-opening the dialog. That
path needs `xdg-desktop-portal` with a ScreenCast backend, PipeWire and
D-Bus installed; none is bundled. It
captures the selected desktop output rather than
promising arbitrary per-window capture. PipeWire's PulseAudio compatibility
layer supplies the default output sink's monitor source for desktop audio.
If the audio service cannot be opened, video capture can continue without audio.

### AMD hardware encoding

On AMD Linux systems, `auto` prefers VA-API codecs when available:

- H.264: `h264_vaapi`
- HEVC: `hevc_vaapi`
- AV1: `av1_vaapi`

The default render device is `/dev/dri/renderD128`. Select another render node
when necessary:

```bash
FTHR_VAAPI_DEVICE=/dev/dri/renderD129 ./FTHRClips-<version>-x86_64.AppImage
```

If VA-API cannot initialize, FTHR falls back to software encoding. A successful
software fallback proves recording works, but does not prove VA-API is
available. NVIDIA NVENC and Intel hardware paths are not part of the current
Linux qualification claim.

### Hotkeys

The default bindings are:

- **F9**: save clip
- **F12**: save screenshot

FTHR uses a private owner-only Unix socket under the user runtime directory.
Hyprland bindings are generated by the app. Traditional `hyprland.conf`
sessions use the generated `fthr-hotkeys.conf` source; Lua-based Hyprland
sessions use the managed FTHR block in the loaded Lua keybind configuration.
Only the FTHR-owned block is replaced, so unrelated user configuration is
preserved. Reload Hyprland after changing bindings if the compositor does not
pick them up automatically.

KDE, GNOME, and other compositors do not automatically import Hyprland binds.
Use the exact command shown in **Settings → Hotkeys** and configure that
compositor's global shortcut facility. Root access and membership in the
`input` group are not required.

### Where clips are saved

The default library is:

```text
~/FTHR_Clips/
├── <game-or-window-name>/   # saved replay clips
├── Desktop/                 # desktop captures
└── Recordings/              # manual recordings
```

You can change the library and recording directories in the application
settings. User settings are kept separately under `~/.fthr/` so updating the
AppImage does not remove them.

### Troubleshooting and diagnostics

Generate a redacted support report without `sudo`:

```bash
bash tools/linux_system_report.sh > linux-system-report.txt
bash tools/linux_appimage_report.sh ./FTHRClips-<version>-x86_64.AppImage \
  > appimage-report.txt
```

Useful checks:

```bash
pactl info
vainfo
ls -l /dev/dri/renderD*
hyprctl monitors
hyprctl binds | grep -i fthr
```

- **AppImage will not start:** try `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` and check that
  the file is executable.
- **No video:** confirm `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, the compositor capture protocol,
  and the selected output. Do not run the graphical test from a headless SSH
  shell. On KDE the log should show `[Backend] Using ScreenCast portal`; if
  it reports the portal as unavailable, check that `xdg-desktop-portal` and
  `xdg-desktop-portal-kde` are installed and PipeWire is running.
- **No desktop audio:** confirm PipeWire/PulseAudio is running and inspect
  `pactl info`; FTHR uses the output sink monitor, not the microphone source.
- **VA-API unavailable:** run `vainfo`, check the Mesa driver and render-node
  permissions, then set `FTHR_VAAPI_DEVICE` if the device is not `renderD128`.
- **Hotkeys do nothing:** confirm the generated configuration is loaded and
  inspect `hyprctl binds`; restart or reload Hyprland after changing bindings.
- **Uploads unavailable:** enable the uploader in settings and complete consent;
  Lustful remains unavailable on Linux by design.

## Windows Setup

Run a locally qualified `FTHRClips-Setup-<version>-x64.exe` and follow the setup steps. FTHR Clips
installs for all users under Program Files and subsequent downloads of the same
product update or repair that installation rather than creating a second entry.
The uninstaller keeps clips, screenshots and exports. It keeps FTHR settings by
default as well; removing settings/cache is an explicit choice. Global hotkeys
work out of the box.

**Requirements:** Windows 10 version 1903+ or Windows 11. Native NVIDIA
H.264/HEVC/AV1 on a same-adapter display is the intended alpha cohort. Stall
mitigations are code-integrated and automated-tested, but the complete physical
qualification must be repeated after those fixes. AMD and Intel paths remain
hardware-unverified; hybrid or cross-adapter capture is not supported.

---

## Build from Source

### Linux

Dependencies: `cmake`, `gcc`, `ffmpeg`, `libpulse`, `wayland-protocols`, `python3 >= 3.11`, `PySide6`

> FTHR uses the FFmpeg bundled next to the capture engine, falling back to
> `ffmpeg` on your `PATH`. It no longer uses `imageio-ffmpeg`, whose bundled
> binary is a GPL build.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FTHR-Community/FTHR-Clips.git
cd FTHR-Clips
bash build_linux.sh
```

The AppImage lands in `build_output/`.

### Windows

Visual Studio 2022 + Python 3.14. See [`BUILDING.md`](BUILDING.md) for the full walkthrough.

```

The native capture engine runs as a separate process and communicates with the
Python UI via shared memory. Windows uses WGC/DXGI capture with the selected
NVENC, AMF, or QSV encoder and WASAPI audio. Linux uses supported Wayland
capture protocols or native X11/RandR with FFmpeg and PulseAudio-compatible
audio. Platform hotkey activation is
forwarded by the UI through the same shared-memory command contract; Linux also
uses an owner-only Unix socket for compositor key bindings.

the uploader is separate from the main app and doesn't work unless deliberately installed. 
Even after it installing it only connects when you allow it to.
